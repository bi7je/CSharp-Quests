> “Three doors stand before you. One leads to freedom and growth,  
> the others to traps and refactoring nightmares.  
> Only those who master the art of **objects** may choose wisely.”

## 📜 Story

You awaken in a torch-lit hall deep beneath the mountain of C#.  
Three enormous **Dungeon Doors** rise before you, each carved from a different material.  
Their surfaces shimmer with faint runes that seem to pulse when you focus on them.

Your goal is simple: **create and control** these doors through code.  
For only by shaping logic into form can you unlock what lies beyond.

## 🎯 Objectives

- [ ] Create a `Door` class with:  
  - `bool IsOpen`  
  - `string Material`  
  - `string RuneCode`  
  - Methods: `Open()`, `Close()`, and `Inspect()`

- [ ] In `Main()`, create one or more `Door` objects.  
  - Let the player interact via console input:  
    - **Open**, **Close**, or **Inspect** a door.  

- [ ] Add descriptive flavor text.  
  - Example: “The oak door creaks open, scattering dust like ancient whispers.”
